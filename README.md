NOTE: This project was created to demostrate that a simple, lighweight and a self-contained unittest framework can be adopted for LLVM-libc. Going forward, this project will not be maintained as LLVM-libc now has a unittest framework of itself (built using this project as a starting point.)

You can find LLVM-libc' unittest framework here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/libc/utils/UnitTest

# unittest
Simple lightweight unittest framework.
